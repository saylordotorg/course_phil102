**Unit 7: Strategic Reasoning and Creativity** <span id="7"></span> 
*While the majority of this course has focused on the types of reasoning
that are necessary to critique and evaluate existing knowledge, or to
extend our knowledge in accordance with correct procedures and rules,
there remains an enormous branch of our reasoning practice that runs “in
the opposite direction,” as it were.  Strategic reasoning, problem
solving, and creative thinking all rely on an ineffable component of
novelty supplied by the thinker.  Despite the seemingly mystical nature
of such activity, however, problem solving and creative thinking are
best approached by following a set of tried and tested procedures, which
prompt our cognitive faculties to produce new ideas and solutions by
extending our existing knowledge.  In this unit, we will investigate
techniques for problem solving, representing complex problems visually,
making decisions in risky and uncertain scenarios, and creative thinking
in general.*

    R01”](http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/creative/creative.php) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this tutorial on principles of creative
    thinking. Creativity is a ubiquitous human activity, not just the
    province of artists and inventors. Human beings solve problems
    creatively every day. The nature of creativity thus incorporates
    both spectacular creative acts and more modest instances of creative
    reasoning. This tutorial explains what all forms of creativity have
    in common.  
        
     Reading this tutorial should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read this tutorial on the creativity cycle. Although
    there remains something mysterious about just what occurs during a
    flash of creative inspiration, there are nonetheless certain
    definite procedures that encourage creative thinking. This tutorial
    outlines a repeatable four-step process for creativity based on what
    is known objectively about the production of novel ideas and
    solutions.  
        
     Reading this tutorial should take approximately 15 minutes.
