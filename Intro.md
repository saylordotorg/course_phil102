Course Syllabus for "PHIL102: Logic and Critical Thinking"
----------------------------------------------------------

This course provides an introduction to critical thinking, informal
logic, and a small amount of formal logic. Its purpose is to provide you
with the basic tools of analytical reasoning, which will give you a
distinctive edge in a wide variety of careers and courses of study.
While many university courses focus on the presentation of content
knowledge, the emphasis here is on learning *how* to think effectively.
Although the techniques and concepts covered here are classified as
*philosophical*, they are essential to the practice of nearly every
major discipline, from the physical sciences and medicine to politics,
law, and the humanities. The course touches upon a wide range of
reasoning skills, from verbal argument analysis to formal logic, visual
and statistical reasoning, scientific methodology, and creative
thinking. Mastering these skills will help you become a more perceptive
reader and listener, a more persuasive writer and presenter, and a more
effective researcher and scientist. The first unit introduces the
terrain of critical thinking and covers the basics of meaning analysis,
while the second unit provides a primer in analyzing arguments. All of
the material in these first units will be built upon in subsequent
units, which cover informal and formal logic, Venn diagrams, scientific
reasoning, as well as strategic and creative thinking.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  

-   describe what critical thinking is, and explain why it is valuable;
-   assess the credibility and reliability of sources;

    ambiguities of meaning from unclearly worded statements;
-   recognize arguments in writing, evaluate good and bad arguments, and
    construct sound arguments of your own;
-   diagnose the most common reasoning errors and fallacies as well as
    identify ways of improving them;
-   describe and apply the basics of sentential and categoricallogic;
-   describe and apply the rudiments of scientific methodology and
    reasoning;
-   analyze and evaluate arguments using visualization tools; and
-   describe and apply the basics of strategic reasoning and problem
    solving.

### Course Information

Welcome to **PHIL102: Logic and Critical Thinking**. General information
about this course and its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** [Professor Nicholaos
Jones](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#ProfessorNicholaosJones)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. A major resource for the course is the University of
Hong Kong’s [Critical Thinking
Web](http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/critical/improve.php) (HTML),
created by Joe Lau and Jonathan Chan.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials,
including the readings, lectures, assessments, discussion forums, and
final exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to prepare adequately for this exam, you will need to
work through the problem sets within the assessments.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you must earn a 70% or higher on the
final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take approximately **72.75**
hours to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the
amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These
advisories should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful
to take a look at the time advisories, to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself. For example, unit 1 should take you approximately
13.75 hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 1.25 hours) on Monday night;
subunits 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 (a total of 3.5 hours)on Tuesday night;
subunits 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 (a total of 3.5 hours) on Wednesday night;
etc.
