**Unit 6: Scientific Reasoning** <span id="6"></span> 
*Unlike the syllogistic arguments we discussed in the last unit, which
are a form of deductive argument, scientific reasoning is empirical.
 This means that it depends on observation and evidence, not logical
principles.  Although some principles of deductive reasoning do apply in
science, such as the principle of contradiction, scientific arguments
are almost always inductive.  Instead of truth and falsity, science
deals in confirmation and disconfirmation.  Nonetheless, there are very
specific rules about what constitutes good scientific reasoning, and
scientists are trained to be critical of their own inferences as well as
those of others in the scientific community.  In this unit, we will
investigate the standard method of scientific reasoning, the
characteristics of good and bad scientific explanations, the principles
of confirmation and disconfirmation, and the challenges of reasoning
about one of the most important scientific concepts, namely causality.*

     Instructions: Read this tutorial on theory choice. In scientific
    practice, multiple theories will frequently be put forward to
    explain the same phenomena. When this happens, scientists sometimes
    use five criteria to guide their decisions among alternative
    theories.

     1.   Given what you know about criteria for theory choice in
    science, such as predictive power, mechanism, fruitfulness,
    simplicity, and coherence, is there anything other than evidence
    that scientists use in determining whether to accept a theory?
    Should there be?  
     2.   Are simpler theories more likely to be true? Is Ockham’s Razor
    always a good rule of scientific reasoning?

    Jonathan Chan’s *Scientific Methodology*: [“Tutorial
    S04”](http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/sci/causation.php) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this tutorial, which outlines some important
    terminological distinctions for dealing with causation.  
        
     Causation is an ideal topic to address in a course on critical
    thinking, because it is something we feel we understand well in our
    everyday lives. Once we begin trying to think scientifically about
    causes, however, we find that fixing the causes of some event
    requires precision and subtlety.

     Instructions: Read this tutorial about Mill’s five methods for
    identifying causes. The 19<sup>th</sup>-century English philosopher,
    John Stuart Mill, proposed five distinct ways in which a cause might
    be identified through observation. While these methods may appear to
    be very close to common sense, it is important to see that they
    represent distinct modes of inference.

     Instructions: Read this tutorial on causality. Make sure to follow
    the Simpson’s paradox hyperlink and read the associated text.  
        
     This tutorial identifies seven different types of causal relations.
    Each type of relation is followed by a set of defining criteria.
    Although each type of relation is a cause-and-effect relationship
    between A and B, information about the context of the interaction
    and the relation of A and B to one another in time affects what we
    can say about the causal relation between them.  
        
     Reading this tutorial should take approximately 30 minutes.

    Causation”](http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/logic_causation.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this example-rich tutorial, which explains the
    difference between the two relationships of correlation and
    causation. Scientists looking for cause-and-effect relationships in
    the natural world need to be careful not to misconstrue causality
    with mere correlation.

    S07”](http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/sci/ce-diagram.php) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this tutorial illustrating two ways of
    diagramming cause-and-effect. Notice that they allow for the
    description of multiple causes and effects from a single event as
    well as for distinguishing between levels of causation.  
        
     When multiple relations of cause and effect are involved in the
    behavior of some phenomenon, representing these relations visually
    is often the best way to get a handle on them and to assist in
    quantitative analysis of the system in question.

**6.2.7 Review of Causation** <span id="6.2.7"></span>

     Instructions: The following passage is an extract from a report by
    *Arizona Daily Wildcat* (June 16, 1999) concerning a study to show
    that certain people can communicate with the dead. Using what you
    have learned about causation, correlation, and causal fallacies,
    consider the potential flaws with the experiment. Assume that the
    report is mostly correct. Summarize your evaluation of the flaws in
    the experiment, and share your thoughts on the discussion forum by
    clicking on the link above and creating a free account, if you have
    not already done so. Review and respond to at least one or two other
    students’ posts.  

    Gary Schwartz, psychology professor and co-founder of the University
    of Arizona Human Energy Systems Lab speaks about his work at the
    University of Arizona (UA). A team of UA scientists and students
    conducted a unique experiment this weekend, probing the possibility
    of an afterlife by studying how mediums commune with the dead.  
        
     Researchers invited a panel of mediums to meet with 10 people whose
    loved ones recently died. The mediums tried to receive information
    from the deceased without prior knowledge about the deceased and
    while under observation.  
        
     Schwartz invited four mediums to participate in the study,
    including famous “superstars” of the psychic world, such as author
    John Edwards, and unknowns, such as California housewife Laurie
    Campbell. The medium sat facing a wall while a researcher looked on.
    A “sitter,” who had recently lost a relative or friend, would then
    enter the room and sit six feet behind the medium. Schwartz
    acknowledged that a few of the sitters were acquaintances of the
    mediums.  
     For up to 10 minutes, the medium and the sitter would sit in
    silence. The medium, who could not see the sitter, would concentrate
    on receiving psychic impressions. A question and answer session
    followed, in which the sitter was allowed only to answer “yes” or
    “no.”  
        
     Schwartz said that the study was set up to minimize communication
    between the medium and the sitter, avoiding conscious or
    subconscious prompting between the two. While the final results have
    not been written up, Schwartz said he was impressed with the
    mediums’ performance. On several occasions the mediums were able to
    pick out the names and personal information of the deceased, he
    said. 

    Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.
