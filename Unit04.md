**Unit 4: Basic Sentential Logic** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit introduces a topic that many students find intimidating:
formal logic.  Although it sounds difficult and complicated, formal or
“symbolic logic” is actually a fairly straightforward way of revealing
the structure of reasoning.  By translating arguments into symbols, we
can more readily see what is right and what is wrong with them, and we
can learn how to formulate better arguments.  *  
  
 *Advanced courses in formal logic focus on using rules of inference to
construct elaborate proofs.  Using these techniques, we can solve many
complicated problems simply by manipulating symbols on the page. In this
course, however, we will only be looking at the most basic properties of
a system of logic.  In this unit we will learn how to turn phrases in
ordinary language into “well formed formulas,” draw truth tables for
formulas, and evaluate arguments using those truth tables.   *   

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 17 hours.

    nature of truth-tables, the definitions of basic logical
    connectives, the rules for constructing truth-tables, the methods
    for using truth-tables to determine whether a well-formed formula is
    tautologous, inconsistent, self-consistent, or contingent. The
    material also discusses methods for using truth-tables to determine
    whether two well-formed formulas are logically equivalent,
    contradictory, or consistent. Finally, it discusses methods for
    using truth-tables to determine whether an argument is valid. Use
    the interactive arrows to follow the examples.
