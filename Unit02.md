**Unit 2: Argument Analysis** <span id="2"></span> 
*Arguments are the fundamental components of all rational discourse.
 Nearly everything we read and write—scientific reports, newspaper
columns, personal letters, and most of our verbal conversations as
well—contains arguments.  Picking them out from the rest of our (often
messy) discourse can be difficult though.  Once we have identified an
argument, we still need to determine whether or not it is sound.
 Luckily, arguments obey a set of formal rules, which we can use to
determine whether they are good or bad.  In this unit, we will learn how
to identify arguments, what makes an argument sound (as opposed to
unsound or merely valid), the difference between deductive and inductive
reasoning, and how to map arguments to reveal their structure.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 11 hours.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read these three tutorials. When arguments are stated
    verbally or in writing, their structure may not be completely
    explicit. Tutorial 06 provides clues about how to identify hidden
    assumptions. Tutorial 07 introduces the important concept of
    induction. Inductive arguments form a whole second class of
    arguments, alongside deductive ones, and will be important in our
    unit on scientific reasoning later on. Tutorial 08 puts together a
    number of the ideas laid out so far in order to describe the
    characteristics of a good argument.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this tutorial on how to reduce valid arguments
    to their basic structure through the use of argument patterns.  
        
     This reading provides a preview of the kind of analysis we will be
    doing a lot more of in unit 4. This kind of strategy is sometimes
    useful with analyzing arguments in real-life situations. For
    example, you might see these types of questions and find identifying
    argument patterns useful for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).  
        
     Reading this tutorial should take approximately 1 hour.
