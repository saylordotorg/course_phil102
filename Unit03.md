**Unit 3: Fallacies** <span id="3"></span> 
*Now that we have an understanding of the structure that good arguments
need to have and can represent their structure visually, we might think
it would be a simple matter to pick out the bad ones.  However,
identifying bad arguments can be very tricky in practice.  Very often
what at first appears to be ironclad reasoning turns out to contain one
or more subtle errors.  Fortunately, there are a large number of easily
identifiable “fallacies”—mistakes of reasoning that we can learn to
recognize by their structure or content.  In this unit, we will learn
about the nature of fallacies, look at a couple of different ways of
classifying them, and spend some time dealing with the most common
fallacies in detail.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 15 hours.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   define the notion of a fallacy;
-   define and illustrate fallacies of inconsistency, irrelevance,
    insufficiency, and inappropriate presumption;
-   define and contrast a variety of common fallacies: straw man,
    gambler’s fallacy, begging the question, red herring, ad hominem,
    appeal to ignorance, appeal to people, complex question, loaded
    question, and non-sequitur;
-   identify fallacies of reasoning in short argumentative passages;
-   describe the nature of a cognitive bias; and
-   describe and identify cognitive biases.

**3.1 Introduction to Fallacies** <span id="3.1"></span>

    Jonathan Chan’s *Fallacies and Biases*: [“Tutorial
    F01”](http://philosophy.hku.hk/think/fallacy/fallacy.php) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this tutorial, which introduces the notion of
    fallacious reasoning. *Fallacies* are arguments that are frequently
    accepted as valid but which contain subtle errors of reasoning. It
    is important to know how to catch fallacies.  
        
     Reading this tutorial should take approximately 30 minutes.

    Fallacies
    Handlist”](http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/fallacies_list.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Study this list of logical fallacies. Dr. Wheeler
    provides an extensive, but by no means comprehensive, list of
    fallacies, alternative names for many fallacies, and further
    illustrations of fallacies. Refer back to this resource as you
    continue with this subunit, noting especially alternative names for
    fallacies you will learn in subunits 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.  
        
     Studying this list should take approximately 1 hour.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this tutorial, which defines the most common
    fallacies. This list narrows down some of the fallacies seen in the
    previous reading and is enough to get us started. We will look at a
    wider sample of fallacies later on in this course. For now, focus on
    being able to define each fallacy and identify the differences
    between the fallacies on the list.  
        
     Reading this tutorial should take approximately 2 hours.

    Forum”](http://forums.saylor.org/topic/review-of-fallacies-in-detail/)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Consider the passages below. If the passage contains
    an argument, identify the premises and main conclusion. For each
    passage, assess whether it contains a fallacy. If it does, then
    identify the fallacy and explain why you made your assessment. Share
    your thoughts on the discussion forum by clicking on the link above
    and creating a free account, if you have not already done so. Review
    and respond to at least one or two other students’ posts.  

    1.  God exists, because many people who believe in God go on to have
        healthy, happy, and meaningful lives.
    2.  Bertrand Russell said that objective morality is possible
        without God. Russell was an atheist, and we all know that he
        slept around and seduced young girls and was nasty to lots of
        people.
    3.  Do you want four more years of this person in political office?
        Vote for me, Candidate X.
