**Unit 5: Venn Diagrams** <span id="5"></span> 
*In addition to using predicate logic, the limitations of sentential
logic can also be overcome by using Venn diagrams to illustrate
statements and arguments.  Statements that include general words like
“some,” or “few,” as well as absolute words like “every,” “all,” and so
on, lend themselves to being represented on paper as circles that may or
may not overlap.  Venn diagrams are especially helpful when dealing with
the logical arguments called syllogisms.  Syllogisms are a special type
of three-step argument with two premises and a conclusion, which involve
“quantifying” terms.  In this unit we will learn the basic principles of
Venn diagrams, how to use them to represent statements, and how to use
them to evaluate arguments.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 6.5 hours.

     Instructions: Read these two tutorials for an introduction to Venn
    diagrams. In Venn diagrams, circles represent sets or classes. These
    tutorials demonstrate how to use shading and overlapping to
    illustrate empty sets, as well as relations of *all*, *every*, and
    *nothing*.  
        
     Reading these tutorials should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Read the tutorial, practice using the flash
    animations, and complete all of the exercises on the page. Once you
    have answered each question, check the [“Tutorial V03 Answer
    Key”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/PHIL102-Subunit5.1.2-TutorialV03-FINAL.pdf)
    (PDF).  
      
     Working with Venn diagrams that involve three circles is almost
    exactly the same as working with ones that involve two circles. The
    only difference is that there are now eight distinct regions, each
    with a specific logical meaning.  
        
     Reading this tutorial and completing the exercises should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read this tutorial on how to use Venn diagrams to
    evaluate arguments. You will be introduced to the concept of a
    *syllogism*, a special type of argument that cannot be evaluated in
    SL. Venn diagrams are ideal for evaluating this type of argument.
    Remember that a Venn diagram can only tell us if an argument is
    valid, not whether it is sound.  
      
     Reading this tutorial should take approximately 30 minutes.
