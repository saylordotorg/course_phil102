**Unit 1: Introduction and Meaning Analysis** <span id="1"></span> 
*Critical thinking is a broad classification for a diverse array of
reasoning techniques.  In general, critical thinking works by breaking
arguments and claims down to their basic underlying structure, so we can
see them clearly and determine whether they are rational.  The idea is
to help us do a better job of understanding and evaluating what we read,
what we hear, and what we ourselves write and say.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will define the broad contours of critical thinking
and learn why it is a valuable and useful object of study.  We will also
introduce the fundamentals of meaning analysis: the difference between
literal meaning and implication, the principles of definition, how to
identify when a disagreement is merely verbal, the distinction between
necessary and sufficient conditions, and problems with the imprecision
of ordinary language.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 13.75 hours.

-   contrast factual disputes and verbal disputes;
-   define and illustrate the notions of necessary condition and
